Introduction to git and github:>
 Git is a open source ditributed version control system

 where as Github is a platform for usuability,issues solving,commenting,receiving,project managment system

Core Concept of Git :>
 -> Sharing of code
 -> versionig
  
  Sharing of code as introduction says it is a a open source developer can share there code via git 

  Versioning is done in git it help us to regain the previous code and delete the update code if consumer demands the previous
  by using command git log and git restore

  In Git devloper can copy their code ,if the centralized server is down we can use the copied branch this copying of code is called Fork

  Git Commands->
   Basic Git commands are 
   1:git init : it initialise the repo
   2:git add . : it add the working directory to staging area
   3:git commit -m : it commits the working directory with a title 
   4:git push origin main : it push the working directory from staging area to local repo
   5:git diff: it shows what exact changes are done in the code
   6: git pull : it used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
   7:git reset --hard: to go back to previous versoning
   8:git log: shows the commited data
These are few  basic commands used by devlopers

What are branches?
 It is copy of main or master brach in which changes are done for checking the working of code without effecting master branch 
 master branch: it is the main branch where developer provides to consumer
 feature branch : in this branch the changes are done and merge with main branch after checking 
 relese branch  : it is used to  ship or deliver the branch to consumer after checking
